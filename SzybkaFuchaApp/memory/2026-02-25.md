# SzybkaFuchaApp — Daily Log 2026-02-25

## What Happened Today

- Project workspace created
- Full product documentation written
- SPEC.md: User stories, features, success metrics
- ROADMAP.md: 3-phase timeline (MVP by Apr 2026)
- docs/architecture.md: Tech stack (proposed), data model, API endpoints
- Decisions documented: Two-sided marketplace, escrow model, single-city MVP, KYC strategy

## Decisions Made

1. ✅ **Two-Sided Marketplace Model** – Connect clients + contractors, not employees
2. ✅ **Escrow-Based Payments** – Platform holds money, releases on confirmation
3. ✅ **MVP = Single City Pilot** – Focus on 1 city, then expand
4. ✅ **KYC for Contractors, Light Verification for Clients** – Balance security + onboarding friction

## Key Insights

- **Product is clear:** We know what problem we're solving (time, trust, chaos in gig services)
- **Model is sound:** Two-sided marketplace with escrow removes main friction points
- **Timeline is aggressive but realistic:** MVP in 8 weeks if team is aligned
- **Legal unknowns:** Need compliance review on KYC/AML for Polish market

## Blockers

- 🔴 **Tech Stack Not Decided** – Need to choose React Native vs Flutter, Node vs Django
- 🔴 **Legal/Compliance** – KYC requirements for payment processors in Poland (urgent for contractor onboarding)
- 🟡 **Insurance** – Do we need liability coverage for contractor accidents?

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Operating Costs Analysis** ✅ DONE (2026-02-25)
   - Hosting: AWS MVP ~$96/mo, scales to $446 by Phase 3
   - Stripe payment processing: MVP ~$918/mo, **biggest cost** (76% of budget)
   - SMS via Vonage: $11 MVP, $216 Phase 2
   - KYC: $50 MVP, $375 Phase 3
   - **Total MVP: $1,215/month**
   - See: `docs/operating-costs.md`

2. **Tech Stack Decision** (by 2026-03-01)
   - Frontend: React Native or Flutter?
   - Backend: Node.js + Express or Django?
   - Database: PostgreSQL confirmed. Redis for caching/queue.

3. **Legal Review** (by 2026-03-05)
   - AML/KYC requirements for Polish payment platforms
   - Contractor classification (employee vs. independent)
   - Liability insurance requirements

4. **UI/UX Mockups** (by 2026-03-10)
   - Client flow: add order → confirm contractor → pay → rate
   - Contractor flow: browse orders → accept → complete → get paid
   - Focus: simplicity, speed

5. **API Specification** (by 2026-03-10)
   - RESTful design (or GraphQL?)
   - Authentication flow (JWT)
   - Real-time chat (WebSocket)

6. **Team Assembly** (by 2026-03-01)
   - Frontend lead
   - Backend lead
   - Mobile lead
   - Product/design lead

## Energy & Clarity

- Product clarity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 – we know what we're building)
- Confidence: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 – model is sound, but execution complexity is high)
- Urgency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 – market opportunity is real, competition emerging)
